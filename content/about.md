![Aditya Krishnakumar](/me.jpg)

Welcome to my website!

I am Aditya Krishnakumar, a DevOps Engineer based out of India. I'm mostly into AWS, GCP & Azure Cloud these days and I like to tinker around stuff like testing out new software (I also advocate self-hosting stuff as well), automating certain things from my job, checking out new products and services offered by the mentioned clouds etc.

Apart from the major clouds, I also like to hack stuff using Linode as my development platform. I find it to have a very simple pricing, DDoS protected network etc.

On the technical side of things, I've worked with these tools/tech either professionally or as a personal project:

1. AWS core toolset (EC2, EBS, S3, CloudFront, Route53, VPC) as well as their niche offerings (Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.)
2. GCP tools (GKE, Compute Engine, VPC, Cloud Build, GCR etc.)
3. CI tools such as Jenkins, TravisCI, BitBucket Pipelines, GitLab CI
4. PaaS platforms such as Heroku
5. and a lot more...

More of this can be found in my [resume](/resume.pdf).

I also have presence in [GitHub](https://github.com/beingadityak), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beingadityak_), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beingadityak) & many more platforms.

I also like to write about:

1. System Administration
2. Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP & Azure)
3. Cloud-native tech (Docker, k8s etc.)
