I am Aditya Krishnakumar, a DevOps Engineer based out of India. I&amp;rsquo;m mostly into AWS, GCP &amp;amp; Azure Cloud these days and I like to tinker around stuff like testing out new software (I also advocate self-hosting stuff as well), automating certain things from my job, checking out new products and services offered by the mentioned clouds etc.
Apart from the major clouds, I also like to hack stuff using Linode as my development platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
